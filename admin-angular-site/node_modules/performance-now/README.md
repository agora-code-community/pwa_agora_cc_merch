# performance-now [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/meryn/performance-now.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/meryn/performance-now) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/meryn/performance-now.png)](https://david-dm.org/meryn/performance-now)

Implements a function similar to `performance.now` (based on `process.hrtime`).

Modern browsers have a `window.performance` object with - among others - a `now` method which gives time in miliseconds, but with sub-milisecond precision. This module offers the same function based on the Node.js native `process.hrtime` function.

According to the [High Resolution Time specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/hr-time/), the number of miliseconds reported by `performance.now` should be relative to the value of `performance.timing.navigationStart`. For this module, it's relative to when the time when this module got loaded. Right after requiring this module for the first time, the reported time is expected to have a near-zero value.

Using `process.hrtime` means that the reported time will be monotonically increasing, and not subject to clock-drift.

# performance-now [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/braveg1rl/performance-now.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/braveg1rl/performance-now) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/braveg1rl/performance-now.png)](https://david-dm.org/braveg1rl/performance-now)

Implements a function similar to `performance.now` (based on `process.hrtime`).

Modern browsers have a `window.performance` object with - among others - a `now` method which gives time in milliseconds, but with sub-millisecond precision. This module offers the same function based on the Node.js native `process.hrtime` function.

Using `process.hrtime` means that the reported time will be monotonically increasing, and not subject to clock-drift.

According to the [High Resolution Time specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/hr-time/), the number of milliseconds reported by `performance.now` should be relative to the value of `performance.timing.navigationStart`.

In the current version of the module (2.0) the reported time is relative to the time the current Node process has started (inferred from `process.uptime()`).

Version 1.0 reported a different time. The reported time was relative to the time the module was loaded (i.e. the time it was first `require`d). If you need this functionality, version 1.0 is still available on NPM.

## Example usage

```javascript
var now = require("performance-now")
var start = now()
var end = now()
<<<<<<< HEAD
console.log(start.toFixed(3)) // ~ 0.05 on my system
=======
console.log(start.toFixed(3)) // the number of milliseconds the current node process is running
>>>>>>> front_end_product_listing
console.log((start-end).toFixed(3)) // ~ 0.002 on my system
```

Running the now function two times right after each other yields a time difference of a few microseconds. Given this overhead, I think it's best to assume that the precision of intervals computed with this method is not higher than 10 microseconds, if you don't know the exact overhead on your own system.
